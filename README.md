# Engineering Knowledge RAG Assistant

## Problem
Engineering teams accumulate large amounts of technical documentation (APIs, design docs, READMEs), but finding precise answers quickly is hard. This project builds a RAG-based chatbot that answers developer questions using internal engineering documents as its knowledge source.

## User Flow
1. Documents are ingested and indexed
2. User asks a technical question in natural language
3. Relevant document chunks are retrieved
4. LLM generates an answer grounded in retrieved context
5. Sources are shown alongside the answer

## Non-Goals
- Not building a general-purpose chatbot
- Not optimizing for research-level accuracy
- Not supporting multiple document types initially
- Not focusing on UI polish
